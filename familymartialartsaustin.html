            <p>I wanted my son in martial arts. I was unsure about the cost/commitment because I'm a single parent. Sometimes things come up that can make long term commitment hard. I started my son because he loved it during the introductory process and I was very impressed with the instruction. Regardless of his fluctuation in interest, he has learned a lot. It's an amazing experience. I highly encourage parents thinking about enrolling there child to try it out. </p>

            <p>The reason we we attracted to martial arts here is that we thought it would help our daughter come out of here shell, to help her with her disciple and to understand the difference between right and wrong and how she should act...We also wanted her to learn to defend herself. We wanted something that would build her up and improve her character...My name is Dolores and I started when I was about 4 or 5 and Kung Fu has helped me come out of my shell.</p>

            <p>When I was 10 my Dad asked, what do you think about martial arts...do want to try that...I was a little hesitant but at the same time I could see myself fighting off bad guys and jumping over walls like Jackie Chan...I came into class, so excited...now I am seventeen and a 2nd degree Black Sash and this is what helps me from making bad decisions, it helps me stay off drugs and alcohol. This has become part of my life; I feel a sense of belonging that I believe everyone feels when they step into the school.</p>

            <p>My son, Asher wanted to do Kung fu. We liked the idea of a group activity and you were highly recommended. Little dragons was awesome! Level of commitment that it may turn into a barrier for me. You all worked with our individual family situation (thank god bc we could not participate at full price on my income and no child support) I am excited that my son Asher can advance to a high level.<br /><br /> We first learned of your school through recommendations from friends on FB. Asher is very serious and feels good about his accomplishments. His focus is better health. Good male role models. He learns respect and routine. The best thing you can do for your kid is enroll him at Master Gohring's Tai Chi and Kung Fu in Austin Texas. :-)</p>

            <p>I wanted my son to express confidence in his personality. I was unsure of the cost of everything. I was happy to see that Grandmaster Gohring was willing to work with me on the price. I enrolled my son because I thought it would be the best for my son. The greatest benefit I have gotten is knowing my son is developing into a strong man. If you are thinking of trying it out. I think you should. It's great!</p>

          <p>Grandmaster Gohring has studied Tai Chi, Kung Fu and Yoga since 1986 with several well-known Masters. He earned his first Black Sash at the age of 17. Shortly thereafter his teacher opened a new school. His teacher said to him, “You’re teaching Kung Fu, you’re teaching Tai Chi and you’re in charge of the kids program.” He replied, “Yes Sir.” and the rest is history. He spent the following few years working for his teachers in their schools. Eventually he started classes in his back yard. In 1996, just as he was graduating from the University of Texas, he opened his own school on Airport Blvd.<br /><br />Now 43 years old and an 8th Degree Black Sash, Grandmaster Gohring continues to enrich the lives of youngsters and the young of heart. Whether they start at age 4 or 84, Grandmaster Gohring and his team provide the individual care and nurturing necessary for each student to reach their full potential. Grandmaster Gohring’s team has established a diverse and welcoming community in his school. He has also become well known in the Austin community as an entrepreneur and founder/owner of Kick Butt Coffee. Come join him and his team and develop your <em>Black Sash</em> attitude.</p>
          <h2>&quot;<em>Black Sash</em> is a metaphor for Excellence.&quot; - Grandmaster Gohring</h2>
