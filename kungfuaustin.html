Right here in Austin Texas Grandmaster Gohring and his team train men and women of all ages, body types and backgrounds in the fundamentals of kung fu. An 8th Degree Black Sash in Shaolin Hung Gar Tiger-Crane Kung Fu, Grandmaster Gohring teaches students at his school that there is no better workout program than our kung fu for getting the body and mind into warrior condition. Kung fu's complete program of both fitness and spiritual lessons can be applied to every aspect of your life: work, relationships, family. Kung fu gives a superb aerobic workout at the same time that it dramatically increases flexibility, power, and speed… the ultimate promise of the program is this: students who stick to the program will be transformed inside and out… and the enormous sense of accomplishment that results will radiate through their life, allowing them to tackle the world with a warrior's confidence, calm, and poise.</p>

            <p>I chose Master Gohring's because I believe it offers the most traditional martial arts experience in Austin. I scouted every school I could find before making my choice. Martial Arts and Kung Fu are not just about self-defense. Kung Fu is a whole body health and training system and a traditional martial art.</p>

            <p>I like learning the moves and working to perfect them. I like doing the routines and am looking forward to learning them from beginning to end. I've always wanted to learn a Martial Art and had read about shaolin kung fu, re-sparking my interest, then I found your school, a great match. I enrolled to learn how to change my instinctive reactions from scared to defense/protection. I enrolled at Master Gohring’s because I liked the teaching style I observed, everyone there is nice and welcoming and the yin yang on the back of the shirts matches my tattoo, almost to the exact placement, it was kismet.</p>

            <p>I'd taken Kung Fu in high school, I've always been interested in martial arts, especially the Chinese martial arts. I wasn't sure at first because I didn't know how the curriculum was set up.<br /><br />My wife gave me a gift of the introdutory package. It's wonderful to be practicing again. I'm more focused and less stressed.<br /><br />If you are interested in classes. I say, go for it. The school is staffed and run by dedicated, great people, and they want you to succeed.<br /><br />The only reason I dont give 5 stars is the value proposition. When I look through the other schools in town, they all offer hour long classes 2-3 times per week for a comparable or lower monthly price. For what I'm currently paying, I'd like a full hour of instruction per class and Id love to get more 1 on 1 coaching within group classes. I often am assuming my form is okay simply because no one has told me otherwise.<br /><br />In any case, thanks to you all for all the hard work you do. I do love the classes, and I see the hard work that goes into running the school.</p>

            <p>I would say I am one of the older folks in the Kung Fu program. I thought I might be too old for kung fu but and in the beginning I did feel a little too old but it turns out with Master Gohring's instruction I have gotten in shape and done very well.</p>

            <p>I was interested in taking hung gar kung fu and my schedule had finally opened up. That paired with the starter package is why I decided to give it a shot. I was a little put off by the price at first.  I was also concerned with sharing the class with children, thinking the class would be toned down. Boy was I wrong! I decided to join your school since it is only ten minutes away from my home! Also hung gar kung fu just clicks with me. I really enjoy the movements and I get a good satisfying work out from it. I've felt healthier both physically and mentally. For new people to the school. Do the introductory special. After meeting Instructor Durkin I was sold.</p>

            <p>I was first interested in taking martial arts because of my uncle. He inspired me through displine and his success in life. I was unsure if I had the commitment that I understood was necessary for becoming great at Kung Fu. After a year or so I know now that I'm am no longer unsure about commitment when practicing martial arts. I joined this "karate dojo" because of it's history. Everyday since the first day I have learned something new about the school. It's inspiring and joyful enraptured me. A great benefit I've acquired from the school is virtue. Joining the school is a grand experience. For its tranquil Tai chi program and intense Kung fu sets.</p>

            <p>I was interested in the classes because of my history with Martial Arts and all the benefits practicing Kung Fu gives me in life. I was a little concerned about the level of difficulty of some the moves that I would be learning. I'm  still working on my flexibility and balance but I know physically that I can do the more difficult moves, with practice. I like this school because It's very traditional in the teaching methods. Also, the staff is very friendly. As of right now, it has been the physical benefit that I have noticed the most. If I was asked I would say that this is a great school of Kung Fu for anybody to come in and learn from experienced instructors. I would highly recommend it.</p>

            <p>I have past experience in Kung Fu, enjoy the somewhat spiritual component of the art and needed a way to in shape. At first I wasn't sure If I could stick to it. I still miss a few classes due to other committments but never due to laziness. I go even if I'm tired and know that I'll just try my best. The children's program attracted us to bring my son in and I saw this was a good school so I signed up too. My back doesn't hurt as much and I"m in better physical condition overall. If you are thinking of trying it I say go ahead and try it!  The instructor's are very experienced and professional.</p>

          <p>Grandmaster Gohring has studied Tai Chi, Kung Fu and Yoga since 1986 with several well-known Masters. He earned his first Black Sash at the age of 17. Shortly thereafter his teacher opened a new school. His teacher said to him, “You’re teaching Kung Fu, you’re teaching Tai Chi and you’re in charge of the kids program.” He replied, “Yes Sir.” and the rest is history. He spent the following few years working for his teachers in their schools. Eventually he started classes in his back yard. In 1996, just as he was graduating from the University of Texas, he opened his own school on Airport Blvd.<br /><br />Now 43 years old and an 8th Degree Black Sash, Grandmaster Gohring continues to enrich the lives of youngsters and the young of heart. Whether they start at age 4 or 84, Grandmaster Gohring and his team provide the individual care and nurturing necessary for each student to reach their full potential. Grandmaster Gohring’s team has established a diverse and welcoming community in his school. He has also become well known in the Austin community as an entrepreneur and founder/owner of Kick Butt Coffee. Come join him and his team and develop your <em>Black Sash</em> attitude.</p>
          <h2>&quot;<em>Black Sash</em> is a metaphor for Excellence.&quot; - Grandmaster Gohring</h2>
