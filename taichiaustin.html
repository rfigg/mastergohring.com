            <p>Tai Chi is helping me in all levels of my life. My body is changing, I am more patient, I am stronger, I am focused and aware. I love walking into the studio and immediately feeling relaxed and ready.<br /><br />I wanted a martial art that was slow paced. My life is busy and I am an action-oriented person. I thought Tai Chi would help me slow down, be more patient, be more aware moment to moment and it has.<br /><br />I feel that Master Gohring's studio was an energetic match for me. I really like the studio and I like the instructor's level of professionalism and sacred-ness to the form. Thanks for providing the opportunity for me to grow as a person.</p>

            <p>Master Gohring, I am amazed how efficiently you and your staff conduct the graduation as well as the classes. Also you and the staff are certainly deserving of a five star rating as instructors and in your relationship in class with students. The inspiration, encouragement, patience, and positive attitude provided for your students of all ages is awesome!<br /><br />Having been a teacher at the elementary, middle school, high school, and college levels as well as principal and teacher trainer, I can honestly say that to have you on my staff would have been a wonderful experience and great asset! Teachers / instructors with your qualities are a rare and precious gift to the profession!<br /><br />It is my good fortune to be a part of your class. Thank you for providing your classes and making them available to me.</p>

            <p>What I like most about Tai Chi is how it teaches you a more varied understanding of your own body. Even as someone who works out in different ways each day I found a lot of things within Tai Chi seem to help you pull from the latent potential that most people never even tap into. Another part which I love is how Tai Chi helps you find what I call  a ‘gentle equilibrium’ in regards to your core and balance.<br /><br />Ever since I was a child I’ve been fascinated by anything having to do with Kung Fu and I’ve always believed in the capabilities of the human body and what it can truly achieve. It also doesn’t hurt to say that I’ve been a huge Jet Li fan for many years and just about all of his films have that spiritual point to them that teach the principals of Kung Fu and Tai Chi and to watch him is truly inspiring.<br /><br />I enrolled in Tai Chi because I felt it would help improve my performance as an athlete and its always something I’ve been fascinated with. Everything about it is beautiful and challenging and I’m not someone to give up easily.</p>

            <p>You may be wondering if this is something you should do, is it worth while? It is for me...I have learned a great deal about balance, physical balance, the ability to hold myself solidly wherever I am both emotionally as well as physically. It happens...I can respond with ease and comfort in all sorts of situations. The kinds of lessons you learn as you are studying tai chi apply to your entire life...</p>

            <p>Tai Chi has improved my health and mental well being, as well as increasing my flexibility and balance. It also seems to be rehabilitating many old injuries.<br /><br />Twice weekly I either leave work or start my day by coming to class. It is one of only three times during daylight hours that I turn my cell off and take care of myself.<br /><br />Following a car accident, I started Tai Chi in response to severe pain in my neck and shoulder that was beginning to radiate into my arm. Although Chiropractic had helped in the past I was becoming debilitated by the injury.<br /><br />I wanted a "soft" martial art. My blood type indicates that I require relaxing types of activity such as Yoga and Tai Chi as opposed to strenuous exercise.<br /><br />It was a flyer showcasing a woman in a Kung Fu pose that caught my eye.</p>

            <p>Hi, my name is Harvey Harris. I've been attending Master Gohring's school for approximately three years. I came here, I'd been a martial artist prior to this. I'd taken five years of kuk sool won, and it was a very hard style, and very hard on my body. I've injured my knee and I wanted to come to take a martial art that would keep me interested in martial arts and at the same time kind of do a little rehabilitation. And after three years of being here I've found that this has actually not just helped my knee but it's gotten me more interested in martial arts then ever.<br /><br />And I'm currently pursuing a Black Sash in Tai Chi and plan on moving on to my second degree Black Sash. And maybe someday go back and get a second degree Black Belt in kuk sool won. But I'm the Executive Chef at Sienna Ristorante Toscana which is a very popular Austin eatery out on 360 and chefs are on their feet all the time. We have to maintain a very high energy level. I'm 53 years old and I've been cooking for 31 years and I run circles around a lot of the younger guys at the restaurant and I attribute this to the fact that I take Tai Chi. And I invigorate my body and I work on it.<br /><br />I highly recommend Tai Chi to anybody who is feeling listless and somebody who wants to you know have a change of life. And a REAL change of life not just change your eating habits but actually change the way you see things because I feel that's what Tai Chi does. It keeps you focused. It increases your awareness. And I'm sure that everybody wants to always be a better person.</p>

            <p>I made an appointment with Ms. Grabhorn, she told be all about the program. I thought, this is something I have to do. I finish each class feeling great about myself, I feel motivated and relieved from stress. The staff is great. You can feel good about yourself here. My balance and coordination have improved a lot. There is something here for everyone at all ages.</p>

            <p>Let me begin by saying that I've spent most of my life being the "bull in the china closet".  My nickname in High School and College, an adaptation of my last name was...wait for it...Spills.  Yep, I WAS that guy.  After learning about many different forms of martial arts and even studying Aikido for a short time, I finally discovered the beauty and grace of Tai Chi.  I thought, if I could learn a great form of self-defense, lower my stress level AND become graceful, that would truly be an amazing thing.  One year in I have a report to offer.  First of all, my blood pressure has dropped from a chin dropping 158/110 to 143/68.  Admittedly, I've been watching my diet in conjunction with Tai Chi but there's no doubt that I've learned to better control my stress as a direct result of studying with Master Tom Gohring and his staff.  I've yet to be really tested on the self-defense end of things and frankly, hope I never will.  However, today, I stand far better suited to accept that challenge that I did one year ago...that I can assure you.  For me, the most shocking development has been the development of grace and coordination.  What I never fully understood is that the slow-moving, learning method helps you to slow down and FOCUS on where you are stepping, moving, shifting so that you can become more AWARE.  What really blew me away is the impact that focus and awareness has had in my everyday life.  In personal interactions, business dealings, traffic...you name it.  I honestly believe that this is one of the driving factors in the stress reduction that I've experienced.<br /><br />Now, take all that life changing impact that I've received studying Tai Chi and add the magic formula.  Master Gohring and his staff.  He has multiple instructors that work with all levels of students.  Friendly, engaging, encouraging and involved would be how I describe them.  I started in the Beginners and Intermediate Course with Instructor Cochran and now also study with Instructor Figg (of Octopus Project fame for you music geeks, like me).  Master Gohring regularly takes over a class, or comes by for individual comments, suggestions or tips.  I also really like the stories he tells, often at the end of class, of his background, Masters under whom he has studied or of the history of Tai Chi in general.<br /><br />For me, Tai Chi has become a path I will travel for the rest of my journey.  Maybe all this grace and coordination will lead to dance lessons next??</p>

            <p>I wanted an exercise program that emphasized stretching, balance, and serenity and didn't play obnoxious music or involve lifting weights or using machines. I didn't know anything about Tai Chi and didn't want to get into a program where everyone was advanced and I would feel lost. UT Informal Classes listed "An Introduction to Tai Chi" and it sounded like the perfect way to get my feet wet at your school.<br /><br />The top benefit I have gotten is a sense of balance and self-control. I would encourage someone interested in classes to enroll at the beginning of a new rotation.<br /><br />You have an excellent Tai Chi program -- it brings beginners along well and encourages continued development.   I think the amount of time required as you get farther along in the program is prohibitive for those who have a full life outside of Tai Chi.</p>

            <p>I first got interested as a means of exercise, increase focus, calm mind and reduce anxiety. I was unsure of having to learn the self-defense applications of Tai Chi. Now I love applications and wish we would do more. I joined the school because I liked the traditional but relaxed atmosphere and felt I would get a high quality of training. The greatest benefit I have received is the increased confidence and the loss of fear. If you are thinking of doing Tai Chi. Come on with it! Everyone should be learning this.</p>

            <p>My Rolfer said that Tai Chi would help with maintaining flexibility. I wasn't sure what Tai Chi really was and whether I would like it. A friend recommended that I try your school and the intro classes were fun. I have gained core and leg strength. And I have a feeling of accomplishment as I have moved through the levels. I would tell prospective students that the teachers are so skilled and patient and that fellow students are fun. The curriculum is designed to build skill and confidence.</p>

            <p>I first got interested to learn tai chi for health, exercise, relaxation, martial art. I had thought about learning a martial art for a long time. I was unsure about being accepted as a student and of the quality of school. I had contacted the school years before, but got no reply, so I thought I got rejected as a potential student. I did get added to the mailing list, though. I finally got up the nerve to contact the school again. :-) I am glad I did because of the awesome instructions and instructors! The lack of invitation was an oversight, and also a result of full classes. I am glad I finally contacted the school again.<br /><br />I liked the location. Saw an ad. Signed up on mailing list. I thought I might like to learn tai chi. I like the sense of well-being, confidence, flexibility, and a sense that I might have learned a bit of self defense. I like being a part of the school community as well. I also have learned a lot about teaching styles, and what works for me.<br /><br />If you are thinking of trying Tai Chi classes here. Go for it! The benefits are absolutely worth it. For children, they will gain focus, respect, self-discipline and much more maturity than their peers. Grandmaster Gohring has a great sense of humor and teaching style that supports people to enjoy and continue learning. There is plenty of variety and challenge to keep it fun.<br /><br />It would be nice to have a taller ceiling and a bigger space. It gets crowded in class sometimes. I understand the need to keep overhead costs down, though.</p>

            <p>I retired after having lived and worked in Germany for 12 years. During my time there, I became interested in T'ai Chi but could not find classes for primarily English speakers. I moved here to Austin to be near family. Finding T'ai Chi classes was a priority for my retirement enjoyment. I have no background in any gross motor skills..no dance, no sports. In other words, no past experience to reassure me I could learn T'ai Chi.<br /><br />I knew I was interested in trying but not at all sure I would be able. Well, I was right. I had a lot of things to learn. But, material is put together to help me learn. It's structured, taught and presented in a variety of ways. I feel like I am moving forward in steps I can appreciate. I did some internet research. This school was the best rated. I was so new to Austin that I had no idea the school I wanted to explore was very convenient to to where I live.<br /><br />It is hard to choose the greatest benefit since there are so many. I'm going to choose the sense of belonging to a group all working on martial arts skills at widely different levels. That really took me by surprise. I've never been a joiner. I'm amazed at how much I enjoy every opportunity to see the kids, Kung Fu, and upper level black sash classes. So much to learn and so many people learning! I am very impressed with all aspects of this school. Coming here has been so rewarding.</p>

            <p>I was first interested because I thought I would enjoy Tai Chi. I was sure I wanted to study at your school, something about being in the room was just feeling right. It is right. It was synchronicity. I have gained the strength of my legs back, and feel so much more physically able than I was when I first enrolled. If you wish to do Tai Chi very well, and willing to take the time, DO IT with Master Gohring's school.</p>

            <p>I took martial arts when I was in my 40's and missed it. In addition to still wanting to do martial arts I was facing some serious health issues and needed to find something else to focus on.<br /><br />I was unsure that maybe i would not be physically able to do Tai Chi, and that it may not fit into my budget. These thoughts were wasted energy. The school is in between my home and work so no matter where I am the distance would not be an issue. Tai chi has taught me to handle stress in a totally different manner and that disabilities regardless of what they are, are not an issue and that they don't define me. What would I say to someone considering Tai Chi. Do it for you. You deserve it. The instructors are great. They not only teach you martial arts but they are caring wonderful people.</p>

          <p>Grandmaster Gohring has studied Tai Chi, Kung Fu and Yoga since 1986 with several well-known Masters. He earned his first Black Sash at the age of 17. Shortly thereafter his teacher opened a new school. His teacher said to him, “You’re teaching Kung Fu, you’re teaching Tai Chi and you’re in charge of the kids program.” He replied, “Yes Sir.” and the rest is history. He spent the following few years working for his teachers in their schools. Eventually he started classes in his back yard. In 1996, just as he was graduating from the University of Texas, he opened his own school on Airport Blvd.<br /><br />Now 43 years old and an 8th Degree Black Sash, Grandmaster Gohring continues to enrich the lives of youngsters and the young of heart. Whether they start at age 4 or 84, Grandmaster Gohring and his team provide the individual care and nurturing necessary for each student to reach their full potential. Grandmaster Gohring’s team has established a diverse and welcoming community in his school. He has also become well known in the Austin community as an entrepreneur and founder/owner of Kick Butt Coffee. Come join him and his team and develop your <em>Black Sash</em> attitude.</p>
